    "text": "Animal Models\nAll procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and complied with relevant ethical guidelines.\n\nApoE4→ApoE2 Hepatocyte Switch Model\nThe primary experimental cohort consisted of ApoE4^flox/flox mice (JAX #034676), which enable Cre-mediated conversion of the ApoE4 allele to ApoE2. At 2 months of age, male and female mice received a single retro-orbital injection of either:\n\nAAV8-TBG-EGFP-T2A-iCre (Cre group; Vector Biolabs, catalog #VB1725), or\nAAV8-TBG-EGFP (GFP control; Vector Biolabs, catalog #VB1743).\n\nThe Thyroid hormone-binding globulin (TBG) promoter confers hepatocyte-specific expression, ensuring that recombination occurs exclusively in the liver. The bicistronic construct contains enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) linked via the Thoseaasigna virus 2A (T2A) self-cleaving peptide to improved Cre recombinase (iCre), enabling stoichiometric (1:1) expression of EGFP and iCre from a single transcript. This design produces ApoE2 expression in hepatocytes, while maintaining ApoE4 expression in all extrahepatic tissues, including brain. Mice injected with the control AAV8-TBG-EGFP vector retain global ApoE4 expression.\n\n\nTargeted-Replacement Controls\nAs reference isoform controls, age-matched 12-month-old male ApoE targeted-replacement (TR) mice expressing human ApoE2, ApoE3, or ApoE4 were included in Batch 2 only.\n\n\n5XFAD Status\nAll TR controls and switch mice (Cre and GFP) in this batch were hemizygous for the 5XFAD transgene (5XFAD⁺/⁻), which carries human APP and PSEN1 mutations driven by the neuron-specific Thy1 promoter. The 5XFAD genotype permits assessment of ApoE isoform and hepatocyte-specific effects in the context of amyloidogenic background.",

The pipeline integrates widely used bioinformatics tools distributed through the Bioconda (Grüning et al., 2018) and Biocontainers (da Veiga Leprevost et al., 2017) frameworks.\nAll the nextsteps were performed by the above pipeline:\nAdapter and low-quality base trimming were performed with Trim Galore v0.6.10 (using Cutadapt v4.9), and read quality was assessed pre- and post-trimming with FastQC v0.12.1. Sequence duplication rates were inspected using DupRadar v1.32.0 to evaluate library complexity.\nHigh-quality reads were aligned to the Mus musculus reference genome (GRCm39, Ensembl release 114) with STAR v2.7.11b, generating coordinate-sorted BAM files via samtools v1.21. Alignment metrics and mapping statistics were summarized with Qualimap v2.3 and RSeQC v5.0.2 modules (read distribution, inner distance, splice-junction annotation and saturation, and strandedness inference).\nTranscript-level quantification was performed with Salmon v1.10.3, and gene-level counts were derived using featureCounts v2.0.6. SummarizedExperiment and DESeq2 objects were generated in R (Bioconductor SummarizedExperiment v1.32.0, DESeq2 v1.28.0) to facilitate downstream normalization and variance-stabilized analyses.\nComprehensive multi-module quality control reports were aggregated with MultiQC v1.29, which compiled outputs from FastQC, Cutadapt, STAR, Salmon, Qualimap, and RSeQC.",

Common DEGs in males and females\nDifferential expression analysis comparing Cre-AAV and GFP control groups in liver identified a large number of significantly altered transcripts (FDR &lt; 0.01, |log₂FC| &gt; 1). To focus on robust and biologically relevant signals, we intersected DEGs detected in both male and female mice.\nThere were 119 common DEGs shared in male and females. The majority corresponded to ribosomal and uncharacterized pseudogenes, reflecting global transcriptional perturbations rather than specific pathway

Females only\nThere are 265 significantly differentially expressed genes (FDR &lt; 0.01, |log2FC| &gt; 1) in the brain between female Cre-AAV and GFP control switch mice.\n\nDiagnostic plots for the DE analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA histogram enriched for low p-values shows the presence of true differential expression (deviation from the uniform null), rather than an all-noise result.\n\nThe log(baseMean) distribution for significant genes being skewed toward moderate–high counts indicates findings are driven by well-expressed features, not low-count noise that can inflate fold-changes and p-values.\n\n\n\nSignificantly differentially expressed genes in brainCre-AAV and GFP control (FDR &lt; 0.01, |log2FC| &gt;
