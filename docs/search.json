At 2 months of age, male and female mice received a single retro-orbital injection of either:\n\nAAV8-TBG-EGFP-T2A-iCre (Cre group; Vector Biolabs, catalog #VB1725), or\nAAV8-TBG-EGFP (GFP control; Vector Biolabs, catalog #VB1743).\n\nThe Thyroid hormone-binding globulin (TBG) promoter confers hepatocyte-specific expression, ensuring that recombination occurs exclusively in the liver. The bicistronic construct contains enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) linked via the Thoseaasigna virus 2A (T2A) self-cleaving peptide to improved Cre recombinase (iCre), enabling stoichiometric (1:1) expression of EGFP and iCre from a single transcript. This design produces ApoE2 expression in hepatocytes, while maintaining ApoE4 expression in all extrahepatic tissues, including brain. Mice injected with the control AAV8-TBG-EGFP vector retain global ApoE4 expression.\n\n\nTargeted-Replacement Controls\nAs reference isoform controls, age-matched 12-month-old male ApoE targeted-replacement (TR) mice expressing human ApoE2, ApoE3, or ApoE4 were included in Batch 2 only.\n\n\n5XFAD Status\nAll TR controls and switch mice (Cre and GFP) in this batch were hemizygous for the 5XFAD transgene (5XFAD⁺/⁻), which carries human APP and PSEN1 mutations driven by the neuron-specific Thy1 promoter. The 5XFAD genotype permits assessment of ApoE isoform and hepatocyte-specific effects in the context of amyloidogenic background.",

The pipeline integrates widely used bioinformatics tools distributed through the Bioconda (Grüning et al., 2018) and Biocontainers (da Veiga Leprevost et al., 2017) frameworks.\nAll the nextsteps were performed by the above pipeline:\nAdapter and low-quality base trimming were performed with Trim Galore v0.6.10 (using Cutadapt v4.9), and read quality was assessed pre- and post-trimming with FastQC v0.12.1. Sequence duplication rates were inspected using DupRadar v1.32.0 to evaluate library complexity.\nHigh-quality reads were aligned to the Mus musculus reference genome (GRCm39, Ensembl release 114) with STAR v2.7.11b, generating coordinate-sorted BAM files via samtools v1.21. Alignment metrics and mapping statistics were summarized with Qualimap v2.3 and RSeQC v5.0.2 modules (read distribution, inner distance, splice-junction annotation and saturation, and strandedness inference).\nTranscript-level quantification was performed with Salmon v1.10.3, and gene-level counts were derived using featureCounts v2.0.6. SummarizedExperiment and DESeq2 objects were generated in R (Bioconductor SummarizedExperiment v1.32.0, DESeq2 v1.28.0) to facilitate downstream normalization and variance-stabilized analyses.\nComprehensive multi-module quality control reports were aggregated with MultiQC v1.29, which compiled outputs from FastQC, Cutadapt, STAR, Salmon, Qualimap, and RSeQC.",

Although tissue and sex distributions were balanced within each batch (50% brain and 50% liver for both sexes), the absence of Cre-AAV samples in Batch 1 created a nesting of treatment within batch that complicated the analysis strategy.\nPrincipal component analysis of the normalized expression data revealed no distinct clustering by batch, and technical replicates clustered appropriately together, suggesting that batch-related technical variation was minimal relative to biological variation. Given this empirical evidence of minimal batch effects, we proceeded with a ~ Sex + group model without explicit batch adjustment. This simpler model is appropriate when batch effects are negligible, as demonstrated by our quality control analyses, and avoids assuming no batch × treatment interaction that cannot be tested with the current design.\nHowever, we acknowledge that this approach makes the implicit assumption that any residual batch effects affect both GFP controls and Cre-AAV-treated samples similarly within Batch 2. The inclusion of sex as a covariate further accounts for a major source of biological variation orthogonal to both batch and treatment effects. While not eliminating potential batch effects entirely, the combination of empirical validation (PCA), cross-batch control representation, and conservative statistical thresholds provides a reasonable framework for identifying differentially expressed genes in this nested design.",

This yielded 63 high-confidence nuclear genes that were consistently dysregulated in response to Cre-mediated ApoE4→ApoE2 conversion in liver, after adjusting for sex effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngene\nbaseMean\nlog2FoldChange\npadj\n\n\n\n\nAkap17a\n212.61\n-1.23\n0.00\n\n\nEno1b\n38.52\n-3.82\n0.00\n\n\nAdrm1b\n37.12\n-2.79\n0.00\n\n\nUba52rt\n210.84\n-1.91\n0.00\n\n\nSap18b\n38.87\n-2.21\n0.00\n\n\nNtn3\n99.71\n-1.11\n0.00\n\n\nCcdc148\n79.22\n1.15\n0.00\n\n\nTenm3\n449.18\n-1.01\n0.00\n\n\nPam16l\n11.47\n-2.74\n0.00\n\n\nEif3j2\n64.91\n-1.78\n0.00\n\n\nNdufb4c\n313.27\n1.10\n0.00\n\n\nKpna2rt\n16.60\n-2.28\n0.00\n\n\nAhcyl\n1261.56\n-1.47\n0.00\n\n\nH2ac19\n648.00\n-1.28\n0.00\n\n\nMir6236\n27.99\n-1.97\n0.00\n\n\nAbca2\n552.28\n-1.12\n0.00\n\n\nAK157302\n7.02\n-3.14\n0.00\n\n\nFmo3\n2642.15\n1.38\n0.00\n\n\nWdr89\n93.95\n-1.15\n0.00\n\n\nNphs1\n5.54\n3.27\n0.00\n\n\nNdufb4b\n122.36\n1.84\n0.00\n\n\nMmp15\n527.71\n-1.04\n0.00\n\n\nUbe2srt\n6.56\n-2.82\n0.00\n\n\nSlc41a2\n264.20\n-1.40\n0.00\n\n\nNrtn\n25.61\n-1.43\n0.00\n\n\nHspb1\n411.97\n-1.12\n0.00\n\n\nRn7s1\n983.84\n1.88\n0.00\n\n\nBhmt1b\n1046.70\n-2.06\n0.00\n\n\nTmed2b\n23.68\n-1.79\n0.00\n\n\nMxd4os1\n28.86\n-1.03\n0.00\n\n\nKcp\n53.80\n-1.20\n0.00\n\n\nGadl1\n8.04\n-2.26\n0.00\n\n\nRn7sk\n217.99\n1.71\n0.00\n\n\nFam222a\n34.27\n-1.85\n0.00\n\n\nWfdc17\n481.54\n1.02\n0.00\n\n\nSerinc2\n275.09\n-1.06\n0.00\n\n\nP2ry10\n14.42\n1.27\n0.00\n\n\nPcbp3\n16.19\n-1.17\n0.00\n\n\nCd28\n9.47\n1.32\n0.00\n\n\nCspg5\n20.63\n-1.88\n0.00\n\n\nMs4a6b\n64.43\n1.05\n0.00\n\n\nOmd\n103.05\n1.10\n0.00\n\n\nP2ry10b\n21.00\n1.15\n0.00\n\n\nBtf3l4b\n27.83\n-1.63\n0.00\n\n\nKlrb1c\n20.92\n1.04\n0.00\n\n\nDmbt1\n62.97\n3.93\n0.00\n\n\nHcn3\n79.45\n-1.36\n0.00\n\n\nArg2\n13.53\n1.21\n0.00\n\n\nSult3a1\n2526.64\n1.08\n0.00\n\n\nOlfm4\n3.58\n3.60\n0.00\n\n\nSpdya\n16.32\n1.05\n0.00\n\n\nZfp1008\n10.77\n1.15\n0.00\n\n\nSult2a6\n15.27\n-1.86\n0.01\n\n\nTaf9\n24.70\n1.02\n0.01\n\n\nCxcl1\n104.02\n1.07\n0.01\n\n\nCldn7\n10.24\n1.14\n0.01\n\n\nTektip1\n8.82\n-2.21\n0.01\n\n\nFasn\n2208.95\n-1.62\n0.01\n\n\nMorrbid\n21.24\n1.08\n0.01\n\n\nAnkrd9\n32.74\n-1.00\n0.01\n\n\nAPOE\n96456.85\n-1.59\n0.01\n\n\nCcl2\n14.66\n1.13\n0.01\n\n\nMs4a4c\n14.38\n1.09\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Brain\nIn brain tissue from all mice, we identified 386 significantly differentially expressed genes between Cre-AAV and GFP control animals using the same statistical thresholds (FDR &lt; 0.01, |log2FC| &gt; 1).\n\nDiagnostic plots for the DE analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the liver analysis, diagnostic plots validated the robustness of these findings. The p-value histogram demonstrated clear enrichment for low p-values, and the baseMean distribution for significant genes indicated that differential expression was predominantly detected in

Common DEGs in liver and brain\nTo identify core molecular responses to ApoE isoform conversion that occur independently of tissue context, we intersected the lists of high-confidence DEGs from liver and brain. This analysis revealed 19 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in both tissues (FDR &lt; 0.01, |log₂FC| &gt; 1):\n\n\nHspb1, Tektip1, Nrtn, Adrm1b, Eif3j2, Pam16l, Ahcyl, Eno1b, Sap18b, H2ac19, Kpna2rt, Uba52rt, AK157302, Mir6236, Btf3l4b, Ube2srt, Rn7s1, Rn7sk, APOE\n\n\nThese shared DEGs may represent core components of the molecular response to Cre-mediated ApoE4→ApoE2 conversion that operate across multiple tissues. Notably, APOE itself was among the common DEGs, confirming successful isoform switching at the transcriptional level. Interestingly, APOE expression exhibited tissue-specific directional responses: expression decreased in liver but increased in brain following Cre-AAV treatment. This divergent regulation suggests that the ApoE4→ApoE2 conversion triggers distinct tissue-specific feedback mechanisms, potentially reflecting the different roles of ApoE in hepatic lipoprotein metabolism versus neuronal lipid homeostasis and synaptic function. The remaining 18 common DEGs span diverse cellular functions including protein homeostasis (Hspb1, Uba52rt, Adrm1b, Ube2srt), metabolism (Eno1b, Ahcyl), nucleocytoplasmic transport (Kpna2rt), and translational regulation (Eif3j2, Sap18b), suggesting that ApoE isoform conversion triggers coordinated transcriptional programs affecting multiple fundamental cellular processes across both liver and brain tissues.",

    "text": "7.3 Differential expression analysis between Cre-AAV and GFP control groups in switch mice\nDifferential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 with a design formula that explicitly modeled batch effects: ~ batch + Sex + group. GFP Control was set as the reference level for treatment comparison.\nOur design involves the same mice measured across batches (paired structure) nested within a batch-treatment confound. The ideal model would be a mixed-effects model with random effects: Treatment + (1|MouseID) + (1|Batch) DESeq2’s standard framework assumes all samples are independent and cannot model the correlation between repeated measurements of the same biological individual through random effects (e.g., mouse-specific baseline expression). Retaining both measurements would violate this independence assumption. While removing Batch 1 duplicates would resolve this, we chose to collapse cross-batch measurements by averaging to preserve all sequencing data. This approach treats each mouse as a single biological unit, though it reduces variance by averaging over real batch-to-batch measurement variability. While this reduces variance by averaging over real batch-to-batch variability (potentially anti-conservative), PCA showed minimal batch effects.\nSignificance thresholds were set at FDR &lt; 0.05 and |log₂FC| &gt; 1, with subsequent filtering to remove pseudogenes, unannotated loci, mitochondrial genes, and ribosomal protein genes.\n\n7.3.1 Liver\nIn liver tissue from all mice (males and females combined), we identified 121 significantly differentially expressed genes between Cre-AAV and GFP control animals (FDR &lt; 0.05, |log2FC| &gt; 1).\n\nDiagnostic plots for the DE analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagnostic plots confirmed the validity of the analysis. The p-value distribution showed substantial enrichment for low p-values, indicating genuine differential expression rather than an all-noise result.\nMost significant genes exhibited moderate to high expression levels (log₁₀ baseMean between 5 and 7), confirming that differential expression was primarily detected in well-expressed transcripts with sufficient statistical power. Very lowly expressed genes contributed minimally, further supporting the robustness of the filtering and normalization procedures.\n\n\nSignificantly differentially expressed genes in liverCre-AAV and GFP control (FDR &lt; 0.05, |log2FC| &gt; 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngene\nbaseMean\nlog2FoldChange\npadj\n\n\n\n\nRps26-ps1\n18.84\n-6.60\n0.00\n\n\nVcp-rs\n65.58\n-2.35\n0.00\n\n\nRpl18-ps2\n30.06\n-2.97\n0.00\n\n\nGm8566\n108.75\n-2.14\n0.00\n\n\nGm10073\n33.39\n-2.97\n0.00\n\n\nGm10263\n18.29\n-4.10\n0.00\n\n\nRpl28-ps1\n58.47\n-1.93\n0.00\n\n\nGstm2-ps1\n53.61\n-2.97\n0.00\n\n\nGm45855\n32.41\n-2.00\n0.00\n\n\nGm4332\n37.02\n-2.56\n0.00\n\n\nGm11478\n50.89\n-2.14\n0.00\n\n\nGlo1-ps\n43.49\n-2.06\n0.00\n\n\nGm16437\n14.46\n-3.16\n0.00\n\n\nGm13611\n13.15\n-4.32\n0.00\n\n\nGm15163\n39.33\n-1.89\n0.00\n\n\nENSMUSG00000143433\n29.55\n-2.66\n0.00\n\n\nGm9816\n17.24\n-2.16\n0.00\n\n\nGm13436\n32.37\n-2.70\n0.00\n\n\nGm10221\n38.13\n-2.11\n0.00\n\n\nGm4366\n59.20\n-1.37\n0.00\n\n\nGlns-ps1\n29.01\n-2.54\n0.00\n\n\nCcdc148\n79.22\n1.29\n0.00\n\n\nEef2-ps2\n25.88\n-2.81\n0.00\n\n\nmt-Ts1\n8.98\n-4.92\n0.00\n\n\nGm12481\n52.96\n-6.89\n0.00\n\n\nLrp1\n8579.16\n-1.08\n0.00\n\n\nGm11964\n10.61\n-3.07\n0.00\n\n\nCox5b-ps\n37.20\n-1.81\n0.00\n\n\nFtl1-ps1\n524.56\n-1.42\n0.00\n\n\nGm14586\n43.58\n-2.27\n0.00\n\n\n2810001A02Rik\n224.90\n1.23\n0.00\n\n\nGm6180\n6.73\n-3.00\n0.00\n\n\nGstp-ps\n133.94\n-2.17\n0.00\n\n\nSlc41a2\n264.20\n-1.91\n0.00\n\n\nRgs4\n54.71\n1.19\n0.00\n\n\nEno1b\n38.52\n-2.73\n0.00\n\n\nMmp7\n15.72\n4.03\n0.00\n\n\nGm8730\n51.91\n-2.43\n0.00\n\n\nRpl7-ps7\n12.77\n-1.98\n0.00\n\n\nRps18-ps5\n46.29\n-2.48\n0.00\n\n\nGm9794\n75.37\n-1.43\n0.00\n\n\nGm7600\n16.38\n-2.82\n0.00\n\n\nGm7049\n17.59\n-2.20\n0.00\n\n\nBnip3\n12935.81\n1.05\n0.00\n\n\nGm6204\n32.82\n-2.68\n0.00\n\n\nGm5805\n13.88\n-3.10\n0.00\n\n\nMov10\n216.39\n-1.22\n0.00\n\n\nArg2\n13.53\n2.31\n0.00\n\n\nMif-ps4\n9.50\n-3.53\n0.00\n\n\nENSMUSG00000140143\n99.65\n2.25\n0.00\n\n\nENSMUSG00000121793\n109.23\n-1.72\n0.00\n\n\nENSMUSG00000128633\n94.62\n-2.10\n0.00\n\n\nGm10076\n1830.86\n1.10\n0.00\n\n\nGm10874\n21.94\n-1.72\n0.00\n\n\nENSMUSG00000139771\n170.64\n-1.66\n0.00\n\n\nLncbate1\n94.08\n1.37\n0.00\n\n\nGm5540\n32.59\n-2.30\n0.00\n\n\nGm5456\n15.84\n-2.87\n0.00\n\n\nGm4149\n35.41\n-2.08\n0.00\n\n\nGm12350\n33.93\n-1.94\n0.00\n\n\nGm12174\n27.14\n-2.06\n0.00\n\n\nGm10232\n15.91\n-2.22\n0.00\n\n\nE030018B13Rik\n64.34\n4.89\n0.00\n\n\nGm16573\n624.05\n1.50\n0.00\n\n\nRps10-ps1\n15.50\n-3.15\n0.00\n\n\nGm9755\n21.25\n-1.95\n0.00\n\n\nGm2962\n11.66\n-2.48\n0.00\n\n\nSlc36a1\n409.28\n-1.03\n0.00\n\n\nGm44170\n66.88\n-1.72\n0.00\n\n\nENSMUSG00000135866\n247.05\n-2.93\n0.00\n\n\nSnhg3\n225.84\n1.56\n0.00\n\n\nMyorg\n671.66\n-1.07\n0.00\n\n\nAbca2\n552.28\n-1.25\n0.00\n\n\nRab11b-ps2\n4.83\n-3.51\n0.00\n\n\nGm10039\n20.42\n-1.90\n0.00\n\n\nNhsl3\n894.50\n-1.10\n0.00\n\n\nMrpl23-ps1\n12.15\n-2.06\n0.00\n\n\nGm56915\n65.26\n1.33\n0.00\n\n\nGm6652\n275.97\n-1.11\n0.00\n\n\nCd83\n93.84\n1.45\n0.00\n\n\nC4b\n16639.92\n-1.04\n0.00\n\n\nENSMUSG00000126438\n14.80\n-2.41\n0.00\n\n\nGm6733\n15.30\n-2.05\n0.00\n\n\nRpl17-ps3\n57.80\n-1.67\n0.00\n\n\nMmp15\n527.71\n-1.23\n0.00\n\n\nPgam1-ps2\n24.37\n-1.83\n0.00\n\n\nENSMUSG00000121505\n150.78\n1.60\n0.00\n\n\nGm10288\n116.74\n-1.48\n0.00\n\n\nAdrm1b\n37.12\n-1.71\n0.01\n\n\nPtprf\n2408.30\n-1.08\n0.01\n\n\nGm57111\n135.57\n1.68\n0.01\n\n\nGm12918\n87.62\n-1.41\n0.01\n\n\nRpl19-ps11\n113.24\n-1.12\n0.01\n\n\nGot2-ps1\n61.42\n-1.01\n0.01\n\n\nGm4459\n14.98\n-2.13\n0.01\n\n\nENSMUSG00000137723\n178.93\n1.39\n0.01\n\n\nRps16-ps2\n81.63\n-1.49\n0.01\n\n\nHspd1-ps3\n59.73\n-1.01\n0.01\n\n\nGm12251\n16.03\n-1.87\n0.01\n\n\nENSMUSG00000142392\n13.48\n6.79\n0.01\n\n\nZnf41-ps\n5.56\n17.34\n0.01\n\n\nAbca3\n1162.54\n-1.05\n0.01\n\n\nGm5422\n13.91\n-2.38\n0.01\n\n\nSntg1\n9.52\n2.94\n0.01\n\n\nTpt1-ps3\n147.96\n-1.14\n0.01\n\n\nGpi-ps\n16.78\n-2.09\n0.01\n\n\nGm9616\n14.66\n-2.26\n0.01\n\n\nRps3a2\n79.40\n-1.17\n0.01\n\n\nRpl23a-ps3\n34.34\n-1.59\n0.01\n\n\nCol1a1\n50.22\n-1.25\n0.01\n\n\nGm10819\n7.05\n-2.83\n0.01\n\n\nGm9625\n29.65\n-1.56\n0.01\n\n\nGm12751\n42.57\n1.40\n0.01\n\n\nSap18b\n38.87\n-1.28\n0.01\n\n\nRps15-ps2\n8.18\n-2.50\n0.01\n\n\nGm28857\n68.21\n2.11\n0.01\n\n\nHspe1-rs1\n39.18\n-1.58\n0.01\n\n\nRpl35rt\n122.60\n-1.57\n0.01\n\n\nMfhas1\n318.41\n-1.03\n0.01\n\n\nFn1\n19990.89\n-1.11\n0.01\n\n\nE230001N04Rik\n24.89\n2.48\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo focus on high-confidence, biologically interpretable results, we applied an additional filtering step to remove pseudogenes (-ps, -rs), unannotated loci (Gm-, Rik, ENSMUS), mitochondrial (-mt), and ribosomal (-Rp) genes.
